        <p id="aboutme"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Duncan Robbins I am eighteen years old,
          and have just recently graduated Central Catholic High School.
          I have lived in Portland Oregon my entire life, yet have also traveled
          around the world a fair amount. I am not the most sociable person yet I
          am still a friendly person if you take the time to get to know me. I am
          also the owner of two Golden Retrievers one of which has just turned one years old
          and the other one is eight years old. I am interested in outdoor activities
          such as skiing and white water rafting, and due to traveling around I have
          been able to experience great amount of each activities. My favorite place to travel to
          so far has been Peru because I was able to spend time in the forests there and see the wildlife
          first hand, and interact with other people who were vacationing there and make some new friends.</p>

        <h2 class="bg-info">My background</h2>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have just recently graduated HighSchool in june of 2019, so I decided instead of pursuing a job through the use of a four year university
          I could instead spend a much briefer time here at Epicodus, and dive deeper into a subject that I was interested in during High HighSchool
          The only working experience that I have prior to this is during summers I used to work as staff at a summer camp called Camp Westwind where I would be in charge of
          providing meals and instructing children in their daily activities at camp.</p>
