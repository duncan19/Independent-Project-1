        <p id="aboutme"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Duncan Robbins I am eighteen years old,
          and have just recently graduated Central Catholic High School.
          I have lived in Portland Oregon my entire life, yet have also traveled
          around the world a fair ammount. I am not the most sociable person yet I
          am still a friendly person if you take the time to get to know me. I am
          also the owner of two Golden Retrievers one of which has just turned one years old
          and the other one is eight years old. I am interested in outdoor activities
          such as skiing and white water rafting, and due to traveling around I have
          been able to experience great amount of each activities. My favorite place to travel to
          so far has been Peru becasue I was able to spend time in the firests there and see the wildlife
          first hand, and interact with other people who were vacationing there and make some new friends.</p>
