        <p id="aboutme">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Duncan Robbins I am eighteen years old,
          and have just recently graduated Central Catholic High School.
          I have lived in Portland Oregon my entire life, yet have also traveled
          around the world a fair amount. I am not the most sociable person yet I
          am still a friendly person if you take the time to get to know me. I am
          also the owner of two Golden Retrievers one of which has just turned one years old
          and the other one is eight years old. I am interested in outdoor activities
          such as skiing and white water rafting, and due to traveling around I have
          been able to experience great amount of each activities. My favorite place to travel to
          so far has been Peru because I was able to spend time in the forests there and see the wildlife
          first hand, and interact with other people who were vacationing there and make some new friends.
          Some of my hobbies are playing video games, hanging out with my pets, and reading. I would stay some of my strongest skills
          are my honesty and my drive to complete tasks that are important to me.</p>

        <h2 class="bg-info"><em>&nbsp;My background</em></h2>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have just recently graduated High School in June of 2019,
           so I decided instead of pursuing a job through the use of a four year university
          I could instead spend a much briefer time here at Epicodus, and dive deeper into a subject
          that I was interested in during High School. The only working experience that I have prior to
          this, is during summers I used to work
          as staff at a summer camp called <span class="westwind">Camp Westwind</span>.
          There I would be in charge of providing meals and instructing children in their daily activities at camp.</p>
